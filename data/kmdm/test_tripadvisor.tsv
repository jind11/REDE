outOfDomain	What can you recommend on your menu to pre-teens?
inDomain	It needs to leave after 14:30. I need a booking for 2 people.
outOfDomain	I was wondering how far the closest public transportation service is? I am considering purchasing a muni 3 day pass, but do not want to walk far as the area isn't very good. Also, I saw another traveler ask about the hotel holding luggage for you, and I was wondering if the price is still 2 dollars per day?
inDomain	Also looking for Chinese restaurant in the cheap price range.
